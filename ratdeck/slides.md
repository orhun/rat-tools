Using `Rust` & `Ratatui`!

Before modern computing, we had simple **terminals**.

And we learned to do a lot with very little.

They changed.

Like everything else.

They evolved.

### Because we always wanted more.

# Why terminals in 2026?

They are **timeless**, and still relevant.

Building high quality and modern terminal applications is still a problem.

And it's a new kind of problem.

It isn't just about Codex.

A lot of modern terminal software
is built with Rust and Ratatui.
